					Let us now set ourselves to consider the origin and nature
					of the <span class="fw-bold">differences of the genera</span
					>. Our attention must be directed to the smallest of the
					concords, that of which the compass is usually occupied by
					four notes—whence its ancient name. [Now since in such an
					interval the notes my be arranged in many different orders,
					what order are we to choose for consideration? One in which
					the fixed notes and the notes that change with the variation
					in genus are equal in number. An example of the order
					required will be found in the interval between the Mese and
					the Hypate: here, which the two intermediate notes vary, the
					two extremes are left unchanged by genus-variation.] Let
					this then be granted. Further, while there are several
					groups of notes which fill this scheme of the Fourth, each
					distinguished by its own special nomenclature, there is one
					which, as being more familiar than any other to the student
					of music, may be selected as that wherein we shall consider
					how variation of genus makes its appearance. It consists of
					the Mese, Lichanus, Parhypate, and Hypate.
				</p>
				<p>
					That variation of genus aries through the raising and
					lowering of the movable notes is obvious; but the locus of
					the variation of these notes requires discussion. The locus
					of the variation of the Lichanus is a tone, for this note is
					never nearer the Mese than the interval of a tone, and never
					further from it than the interval of two tones. There lesser
					of these extreme intervals is recognized as legitimate by
					those who have grasped the principle of the Diatonic Genus,
					and those who have not yet mastered it can be led by
					particular instances to the same admission. The greater of
					these extreme intervals, on the other hand, finds no such
					universal acceptance; but the reason for this must be
					postponed to the sequel. That there is a style of
					composition which demands a Lichanus at a distance of two
					tones from the Mese, and that far from being contemptible it
					is perhaps the noblest of all styles—this is a truth which
					is indeed far from patent to most musical students of
					to-day, though it would become so if they were led to the
					apprehension of it by the aid of concrete examples. But to
					any one who possesses an adequate acquaintance with the
					first and second styles of ancient music, it is an
					indisputable truth. Theorists who are only familiar with the
					style of composition now in vogue naturally exclude the
					two-tone Lichanus, the prevailing tendency being to the use
					of the high Lichani. The ground of this fashion lies in the
					perpetual striving after sweetness, attested by the fact
					that time and attention are mostly devoted to chromatic
					music, and that when the enharmonic is introduced, it is
					approcimated to the chromatic, while the ethical character
					of the music suffers a corresponding deflection. Without
					carrying this line of thought any further, we shall assume
					the locus of the Lichanus to be a tone, and that of the
					Parhypate to be the smallest diesis, as the latter note is
					never nearer to the Hypate that a diesis, and never further
					from it than a semitone. For the loci do not overlap; their
					point of contact serves as a limit to both of them. The
					point of pitch upon which the Parhypate in its ascent meets
					the Lichanus in its descent supplies a boundary to the loci,
					the lower locus being that of the Parhypate, the higher that
					of the Lichanus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having thus determined the total loci of the Lichanus and
					Parhypate, we shall now proceed to ascertain the loci as
					qualified by genus and <span class="fst-italic">shade</span
					>. The proper method of investigating whether the Fourth can
					be expressed in terms of any lower intervals, or whether it
					is incommensurable with them all, is given in my chapter on
					'Intervals ascertained by the principle of Concord.' Here we
					shall assume that its apparent value is correct, and that it
					consists of two and a half tones. Again, we shall apply the
					term Pycnum to the combination of two intervals, the sum of
					which is less that the complement that makes up the Fourth.
					Let us now, starting from the lower of the two fixed notes,
					take the least Pycnum: it will consists of the two least
					enharmonic diesis; while a second Pycnum, taken from the
					same note, will consists of two of the least chromatic
					dieses. This gives the two lowest Lichani of two genera—the
					enharmonic and the chromatic; the enharmonic Lichani being
					in general, as we saw, the lowest, the chromatic coming
					next, and the diatonic being the highest. Again, let a third
					Pycnum be taken, still from the same note; then a fourth,
					which is equal to a tone; then fifthly, from the same note,
					let there be taken a scale consisting of a tone and a
					quarter; then a sixth scale consisting of a tone and a half.
					We have already metioned the Lichani bounding the first and
					second Pycna; that bounding the third is chromatic, and the
					special chroma to which it belongs is called the
					<span class="fst-italic">Hemiolic</span>. The Lichanus bound
					the fourth Pycnum is also chromatic, and the special class
					to which it belongs is called the
					<span class="fst-italic">Tonic</span> Chromatic. The fifth scale
					is too great for a Pycnum, for here the sum of the intervals
					between the Hypate and Parhypate and between the Parhypate and
					the Lichanus is equal to the interval between the Lichanus and
					the Mese. The Lichanus bounding this scale is the lowest diatonic.
					The sixth scale we assumed is bounded by the highest diatonic
					Lichanus. Thus the lowest chromatic Lichanus is one-sixth of
					a tone higher than the lowest enharmonic; since the chromatic
					diesis is greater than the enharmonic by one-twelfth of a tone—the
					third of a quantity being one-twelfth greater than the fourth—and
					similarly the two chromatic diesis exceed the two enharmonic
					by double that quantity, namely one-sixth—an interval smaller
					than the smallest admitted in melody. Such intervals are not
					melodic elements, or in other words cannot take an independent
					place in a scale. Again, the lowest diatonic Lichanus is seven-twelfths
					of a tone higher than the lowest chromatic; for from the former
					to the Lichanus of the hemiolic chroma is half a tone; from this
					Lichanus to the enharmonic is a diesis; from the enharmonic Lichanus
					to the lowest chromatic is one-sixth of a tone; while from the
					lowest chromatic to that of the hemiolic chroma is one-twelfth
					of a tone. But as a quarter consists of three-twelfths, it is
					clear that there is the interval just mentioned between the lowest
					diatonic and the lowest chromatic Lichanus. The highest diatonic
					Lichanus is higher than the lowest diatonic by a diesis. These
					considerations show the locus of each of the Lichani. Every Lichanus
					below the chromatic is enharmonic, every Lichanus below the diatonic
					is chromatic down to the lowest chromatic, and every Lichanus
					lower than the highest diatonic is diatonic down to the lowest
					diatonic. For we must regard the Lichani as infinite in number.
					Let the voice become stationary at any point in the locus of
					the Lichanus here demonstrated, and the result is a Lichanus.
					In the locus of the Lichanus there is no empty space—no space
					incapable of admitting a Lichanus. The point we are discussing
					is one of no little importance. Other musicians only dispute
					as to the position of the Lichanus—whether, for instance, the
					Lichanus in the enharmonic species is two tones remove from the
					Mese or holds a higher position, thus assuming but one enharmonic
					Lichanus; we, on the other hand, not only assert that there is
					a plurality of Lichani in each class, but even declare that their
					number is infinite.
				</p>
				<p>
					Passing from the Lichani we find but two loci for the
					Parhypate, one common to the diatonic and chromatic genus
					and one peculiar to the enharmonic. For two of the genera
					have the Parhypate in common. Every Parhypate lower than the
					lowest chromatic is enharmonic; every other down to the
					point of limitation is chromatic <span class="fst-italic"
						>and</span> diatonic. As regards the intervals, while that
					between the Hypate and Parhypate is either equal to or less than
					that between the Parhypate and the Lichanus, the latter my be
					less than, equal to, or greater than that between the Lichanus
					and the Mese, the reason being that the two genera have the Parhypate
					in common. We can have a melodious tetrachord with the lowest
					chromatic Parhypate and the highest diatonic Lichanus. Enough
					has now been said to show how great is the locus of the Parhypate
					both in respect of its subdivisions and when regarded as a whole.
