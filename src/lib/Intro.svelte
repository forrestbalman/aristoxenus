		A brief intro to Aristoxenus, and <span class="fst-italic"
			>Elementa Harmonica</span>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Aristoxenus of Tarentum was one of the foremost philosophers of his
		time. Although he authored upwards of 453 books during his lifetime
		covering topics beyond the realm of music, his treatise on harmony, <span
			class="fst-italic">Elementa Harmonica</span
		>, isn't only arguably his most important contribution to the music
		theory of his time, but it's also one of the most important insights we
		have to music from Greek antiquity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the span of the three books that make up the treatise, in
		comparison to Greek theorists that preceded him, Aristoxenus wrote about
		theory from a "practicality-first" perspective. By no means does he
		entirely do away with the mathematical principles that informed his
		practice; however, there seems to be a stronger emphasis on whether or
		not any theoretical pitch material is pragmatic to the practicing
		musician.

<h3>My attempt to introduce Aristoxenus' theories</h3>
<div id="excerpt">
	<p>
		Because this website is now dedicated to the entire treatise, I want to
		start off by saying that the original inspiration is a particular
		section from <span class="fst-italic">Elementa Harmonica</span>
		where Aristoxenus describes the
		<a class="accent-text" href="/differences-of-the-genera"
			>differences of the genera differences of the genera
		</a>. If you have no previous experience with Greek music theory (like
		me before reading), you might find the writing to be challenging to
		grasp because of the writing style, as well as the core vocabulary that
		Aristoxenus assumes the reader knows. The rest of this article is going
		to attempt to explain some of what I think are the biggest takeaways
		from this section. But first, let's cover some key terms as they are
		referenced in and around the excerpt.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another important tidbit is that I'm using a particular translation of
		the treatise, <span class="fst-italic"
			>The Harmonics of Aristoxenus</span> authored by Henry S. Macran. I'll
		be including page numbers, which are specific to this book. It has detailed
		notation and a hefty notes section that explains a lot of what I'm going
		to attempt to explain here.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as the structure of the rest of the webpages devoted to each of
		the 3 books are concerned, I'm going to include quotes from the
		translation that I found particularly meaningful to Aristoxenus' overall
		message, as well as some of my own commentary.
