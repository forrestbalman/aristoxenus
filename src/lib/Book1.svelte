		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>
			After reading the treatise and going back through my notes, this is
			definitely a case where reading the book out of order is probably
			better for understanding some of the concepts in Book 1. Aristoxenus
			introduces a lot of concepts that won't end up getting explained
			entirely until Book 2 and Book 3. That being said, some of the big
			takeaways are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Aristoxenus is noticing a trend of not giving Enharmonic and
				Chromatic genera the respect they deserve.
			</li>
			<li>
				Aristoxenus has beef üêÑ with the Harmonists (namely Eratocles),
				whose theories have proven to strip music of its humanity.
			</li>
			<li>
				Aristoxenus is a proponent of the voice as a metric for
				determining what should be theoretically relevant.
			</li>
			<li>
				There's a distinction between speaking and sining, and it mainly
				has to do with discernable pitch.
			</li>
			<li>
				Even though some intervals might be deemed irrational to
				Aristoxenus' predecessors, the human ear can still discern them
				and use them for practical music-making.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tetrachords are a series of (usually) four notes (three
				consecutive intervals) that occupy the span of a perfect Fourth.
				The smallest interval is always between the lowest two pitches,
				and must be between 1/4 tone and 1/2 tone. The highest interval
				must be between 1 and 2 tones.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are three families (genera) of tetrachord: Enharmonic,
				Chromatic, and Diatonic, and at this point in history, Diatonic
				tetrachords are the newest and most unfamiliar.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are certain tetrachords that are more favored than others,
				but in theory, tetrachord intervals are an infinite spectrum, so
				long as their first and last intervals fall within the ranges
				above.
			</li>
		</ol>

			"[The enharmonicists] confin[ed] themselves to what is but the third

			a single magnitude in that third part, namely the Octave." (166)
		</h5>
		<p>
			If you know about what <span class="fst-italic">enharmonic</span> means
			in the context of Greek music theory, then there's more to unpack in
			this quote; however, because Aristoxenus goes into detail about what
			enharmonic (and the rest of the tetrachord genera) means later on, the
			main takeaway from this quote is how Aristoxenus throws shade in the
			direction of his predecessors quite frequently in his treatise. Whether
			it's because his theories were met with resistance by his contemporaries,
			or because he genuinely felt the need to criticize the foundations of
			his musical progenitors, Aristoxenus' writing is full of snarky remarks
			like this, and through the lens of someone who's excited by juicy drama
			in historical texts, these can be fun to read in an otherwise ultra-dense,
			stream of consciousness writing style.

			‚ÄúThe truth is that of all the objects to which the five senses apply
			not one other is characterized by an orderliness so extensive and so
			perfect.‚Äù (168)
		</h5>
		<p>
			This is one of the first hints we get in the book that discusses the
			idea of sense perception as an important factor in finding
			significance in music theory. Aristoxenus suggests that the order in
			which we classify sounds is unique to hearing as a sense, and that
			instead of relying purely on the mathematical relationships between
			intervals, we should also account for our tendencies and intuitions
			when it comes to hearing and producing pitch.

		<h5 class="voice-text">
			"Every voice is capable of change of position, and this change may
			be either continuous or by intervals." (170)
		</h5>
		<p>
			Aristoxenus presents a binary of continuous and intervallic vocal
			delivery. Continuous refers to the "motion of speech" (171), where
			he's observed that the voice never stays on a single identifiable
			pitch for a long enough time to perceive it. Intervallic refers to
			the opposite, where the voice moves between stations that have
			discernable pitch.

	<div>
		<h5 class="voice-text">
			"...tension takes place when the string is in motion, height of
			pitch when it is stationary." (173)
		</h5>
		<p>
			Here, Aristoxenus discusses 4 qualities of a string in motion:
			tension, relaxation, height, and depth. Tension refers to the motion
			from a lower frequency, to a higher frequency, and relaxation is the
			opposite. Somewhat confusingly, height and depth are used separately
			to describe the result of tension and relaxation, respectively.
			Aristoxenus justifies the need for both sets of terms by suggesting
			that one set of terms is used to describe the motion, and the other
			set is used to describe the result of the motion. Even though this
			quote translates to refer explicitly to a string, I think it's safe
			to assume that Aristoxenus is using the string as a metaphor for the
			states that any pitch producing object can be in.

			"What the voice cannot produce and the ear cannot discriminate must

		</h5>
		<p>
			In this quote, Aristoxenus is plainly suggesting that intervals that
			aren't practical to produce, nor readily discernable by ear,
			shouldn't be focused on theoretically. In this section, he
			introduces the terms <span class="fst-italic">in parvitatem</span>
			and <span class="fst-italic">in magnitudinem</span> to describe 2 types
			of interval relationships, the former being too small to sing/hear accurately,
			and the latter being large enough to sing/hear.

		</h5>
		<p>
			Aristoxenus defines notes as remaining on a pitch for a period of
			time. This makes sense, but I'm curious about whether or not this
			brings into question embellishments like slides and scoops. Could a
			note not consist of a gradient of pitches?

			‚ÄúA scale, again, is to be regarded as the compound of two or more

		</h5>
		<p>
			This definition challenges our modern usage of the word scale. A
			"compound of two or more intervals" would more likely fit our
			definition of a <span class="fst-italic">chord</span>, which
			Aristoxenus also uses somewhat interchangeably throughout his
			treatise. However the important things to bear in mind are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Scales are a minimum of 3 notes in length (2 intervals results
				in 3 notes total).

		</h5>
		<p>
			I thought this quote of Aristoxenus getting defensive about his
			definitions shows a bit of vulnerability (or trouble to appear
			vulnerable) on his part. He appears to be aware that these
			definitions are broad, and leave some room for criticism; however,
			he also suggests that making definitions that are universally true
			is a challenge. It reads a little like a cop-out in place of

			"The first classification of intervals distinguishes them by their
			compass,...concordant or discordant,...simple or
			compound,...divi[sion] according to the musical genus,...[and]
			rational or irrational." (176)
		</h5>
		<p>
			Aristoxenus goes into detail about intervals here, suggesting that
			they have certain qualities that allow them to be classified.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Compass refers to the relative distance of intervals. For
				example, C to D would have a smaller compass than C to F
			</li>
			<li>
				Concordant intervals are what we would call <span
					class="fst-italic">perfect</span
				>: Fourths, Fifths, Octaves, and their compounds. Notice that
				Unisons are excluded, since Aristoxenus will go on the refer to
				the Fourth as the "smallest concord." Discordant intervals are
				all non-concordances.
			</li>
			<li>
				While our understanding of simple and compound intervals has to
				do with them being contained within the octave or a sum of a
				simple interval and an octave, Aristoxenus may not be using the
				term in the same way. Compound intervals might be intervals that
				can be divided into smaller intervals. For example, a Fourth
				might be considered compound because it can be divided into a
				series of tones, semitones, and even smaller intervals. Later in
				the treatise, Aristoxenus will go on to explain more about how
				context determines whether larger intervals (like the ditone
				(major Third)) can be simple or compound depending on context.
			</li>
			<li>
				Division according to the musical genus is a bit more
				convoluted, and gets explained indirectly in more detail later
				in the treatise. <span class="fst-italic">Genus</span>
				refers to the quality of the 3 types of tetrachords (4 note pitch
				collections that Aristoxenus explains in much more detail later,
				but he writes about it as if you're already familiar with the concept).
				From what I can gather from this, it can refer to either the interval
				belonging to a particular genus, or a compound interval's genus as
				a result of it being divided in a particular fashion. My hunch is
				that it's the latter, since Aristoxenus goes on to talk about scales
				being classified using the same qualities as intervals, with a few
				additional qualities as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				An interval's rationality, ultimately, has to do with it's
				ability to be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers. A perfect
				Fourth, for instance, can be represented as a 4:3 ratio above
				the reference pitch. However, while Aristoxenus doesn't outright
				reject the mathematical principles that go into explaining the
				theory behind the intervals, Aristoxenus puts more of an
				emphasis on the ear's ability to perceive pitch. This results in
				Aristoxenus making use of intervals like the quarter tone, for
				instance. It can be identified by ear, and sung, but expressing
				it as a whole number ratio isn't practical.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h5 class="rules-text">
			‚ÄúIn scales will be found, with one exception, all the distinctions
			which we have met in intervals.‚Äù (177)
		</h5>
		<p>
			Aristoxenus says that scales follow all the same classifications as
			intervals, with the exception of simple and compound. While removing
			that quality, he adds three more in its place.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<span class="fw-bold">Conjunct and disjunct</span> refers to the
				scales formation as a series of tetrachords. Conjunct refers to a
				scale that is formed by tetrachords that share a note. For example,
				a scale that consists of C > D > E > F > G > A > B, is a series of
				two intervallically identical tetrachords that share the note F.
				Disjunct refers to a scale that is formed by tetrachords that have
				a space in between them (Aristoxenus elaborates later that this gap
				is always a tone). For example, a scale that consists of C > D >
				E > F > G > A > B > C, is a series of two tetrachords (that happen
				to have different intervallic profiles) that have a gap in between
				them.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="fw-bold">Transilient and continuous</span> refers to
				the way notes progress from one to the next. Transilient refers to
				the presence of a gap larger than a tone between notes. For example,
				C > E > G, which looks like a major triad, could be described as
				a transilient scale. Continuous refers to scales with stepwise (or
				smaller) distances between notes. For example, C > D > E would be
				considered continuous.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="fw-bold">Single, double, or multiple</span>
				refers to the number of scales needed to construct it. A tetrachord,
				for instance, would be classified as a single scale because it's
				a standalone unit used to make larger scales. A double scale would
				be a scale comprised of two tetrachords, like the C > D > E > F >
				G > A > B > C scale I mentioned earlier. A multiple scale would be
				a scale comprised of more than two tetrachords. The introduction
				of the book talks about the
				<span class="fst-italic">Greater Complete System</span>, which
				is a series of 4 tetrachords that span the entire compass of
				what Aristoxenus considered to be the practical range of the
				voice.

			‚ÄúAny melody we take that is harmonized on one principle is diatonic
			or chromatic or enharmonic...the diatonic must be granted to be the
			first and oldest, inasmuch as mankind lights upon it before the
			others...the chromatic comes next....The enharmonic is the third and
			most recondite‚Ä¶and with great labour and difficulty, that the ear
			becomes accustomed to it.‚Äù (178)
		</h5>
		<p>
			This quote stood out to me for a couple of reasons. First, and less
			important for now, is that Aristoxenus reintroduces the names of the
			three tetrachord genera: enharmonic, chromatic, and diatonic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, and more importantly, is that Aristoxenus gives insight to
			the history behind them. Enharmonic is described with a sense of
			reverence due to it being the "first and oldest," since he suggests
			it was the first genus that was discovered.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chromatic is also really interesting because all Aristoxenus says
			about it is that it comes second. There's probably a bunch of
			research that can (or has) been done about the Chromatic genus in
			particular, but seeing that we'll find out that the Chromatic genus
			is arguably the most complex of the three, it's interesting to see
			that Aristoxenus doesn't go into much detail about it here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, the diatonic genus, which we know to be most akin to the
			major scale using our modern sensibilities, is described to have
			little known about it in comparison to the other two. And,
			surprisingly to me, it's also described as needing "great labour" to
			get sonically accustomed to. This is fascinating because I find the
			other two tetrachords (you can use the calculator above along with
			the preset buttons to hear them right now) to be much more
			challenging due to the sub-semi-tone intervals. It makes me wonder
			about our ability to get conditioned to certain sounds, and whether
			or not Diatonic tetrachords were comprised of the intervals we think
			they were.

			‚ÄúThe nature of melody in the abstract determines which concord has
			the least compass. Though many smaller intervals than the Fourth
			occur in melody, they are without exception discords...we find no
			similar determination for the greatest...concords seem capable of
			infinite extension just as much as discords.‚Äù (179)
		</h5>
		<p>
			This section reiterates a lot of what we already know. Aristoxenus
			suggests that intervals smaller than the Fourth are all discords.
			This would technically include the Unison, so the Fourth by
			definition is the smallest concord. He also suggests something I
			find really progressive which is the idea of infinite expansion and
			diminution. Concords don't appear to have a limit if you keep adding
			octaves to the smaller concords (Fourths and Fifths). Although our
			ability to hear and sing them stops at a point. Similarly, discords
			can continue to shrink as intervals within the Fourth are divided. I
			don't know whether or not this is objectively progressive, but my
			instinct about music from a historical perspective is that the
			further back in time you go, the more restrictive the music theory
			seems to be. Considering the history of Western European music is
			told through the lens of harmony becoming more and more complex,
			it's interesting to see writing that suggests possibilities for
			pitches that are smaller than the semitone, which wouldn't get a ton
			of attention until the 20th century.

			"A tone is the difference in compass between the first two

			while undeniably rejecting any interval less than these...the
			smallest enharmonic diesis, the next the smallest chromatic diesis,
			and the greatest, a semitone.‚Äù (180)
		</h5>
		<p>
			I thought this excerpt was interesting because Aristoxenus goes into
			detail about defining what a tone is. Not only does it remind me
			that there are things we take for granted in music that we just
			accept as true because we were told they were true, but it also
			reinforces the idea that to Aristoxenus, the Fourth is the smallest
			concord. Subtracting the difference between the Fourth and the
			Fifths results in a tone.
		</p>
		<p>
			He also goes into detail about divisions of the tone (which would
			result in irrational intervals, by the way) by the "three lowest
			denominators": 2, 3, and 4. This results in semi (half), third, and
			quarter tones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, he introduces the word <span class="fst-italic">diesis</span
			>, which is the smallest interval of a tetrachord. The quarter tone
			is the "smallest Enharmonic diesis," the third tone is the "smallest
			chromatic diesis," and the, "greatest, a semitone." Going back to
			reading this quote, I think phrasing is important for understanding
			everything Aristoxenus is trying to say here. If the quarter tone is
			the smallest Enharmonic diesis, and the third tone is the smallest
			chromatic diesis, that implies that all tetrachords with a diesis
			smaller than a third tone are Enharmonic, and all tetrachords with a
			diesis larger than a third are Chromatic. Something that's easy to
			glance over, but probably the most imporant takeaway is that the
			semi tone isn't referred to as a diesis, but as a "greatest"
			interval. This implies that location of the diesis (which we'll
			learn will always be between the 1st and 2nd notes of the
			tetrachord) can't be larger than a semi tone, and that the semi tone
			isn't assigned to a particular genus because it can be found in both
			Chromatic and Diatonic tetrachords (more on this later).

			This is Aristoxenus' base definition of a tetrachord. It spans the
			range of "the smallest of the concords," which we know to be a
			perfect Fourth, and that it usually contains 4 notes. All the
			examples Aristoxenus gives contain 4 notes, but there could
			potentially more, or maybe even less. I always assumed the "tetra"

			This section describes a rule for the interval between Lichanus and

		</p>
		<p>
			When the interval between Lichanus and Mese is a tone, the
			tetrachord can be classified as Diatonic. And when the interval
			between Lichanus and Mese is 2 tones, the tetrachord can be
			classified as Enharmonic. Aristoxenus excludes the Chromatic,
			because it occupies a space in between the two extremes (we'll learn
			that, just like the case of dieses occupying a range of intervals,
			that the range between Lichanus and Mese is also a range).

		<p>
			This is a bit of a philosophical aside that suggests some important
			information about Aristoxenus' perspective on the three genera. From
			an ethical standpoint, Aristoxenus is suggesting that during his
			time, the Enharmonic and Chromatic genera were being unfairly
			likened to one another (try them both in the calculator to compare
			for yourself). Because they are distinct, lumping them together
			would result in an ethical dilemma. Admittedly, the Enharmonic and
			(Soft) Chromatic tetrachords are very similar due to their sub
			semi-tone dieses; however Aristoxenus seems to be advocating for a
			theory that acknowledges them both as distinct. Perhaps he feared
			that the direction music was going would've resulted in a loss of
			any non-diatonic genera. In hindsight, he was somewhat right, as
			most Western music theory is based on Diatonic scales. Ironically,
			the Chromatic scale was reappropriated by Western theorists to

			The first scenario involves making an Enharmonic tetrachord with

			Like I mentioned in the above commentary, this quote is set up to
			explain Aristoxenus' process of deriving 6 shades of the 3
			tetrachord genera.
		</p>
		<p>
			The third Pycnum being "taken, still from the same note" is by far
			the most unintuitive part of the six part process. In fact, I'm
			suspicious that this might even be a mistranslation given how
			Aristoxenus elaborates on the structure of this third shade of
			tetrachord. Even though Aristoxenus says to take a pycnum from the
			same note, which would imply a 2/3 tone interval, the third shade he
			refers to is called the <span class="fst-italic">Hemiolic</span>
			Chromatic (more on this later). This tetrachord is actually made up of
			3/8 tone + 3/8 tone + 1 3/4 tones. The sum of 3/8 and 3/8 is 6/8 or 3/4s,
			not 2/3s, and serves as another division of the tone before we get to
			the 1/2 tone. In summary, I don't understand why Aristoxenus says to
			take a pycnum from the same note, when this doesn't end up being the
			case.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fourth case describes what Aristoxenus will call the <span
				class="fst-italic">Intense</span> Chromatic tetrachord. The pycnum
			is equal to a tone, which implies that it's the result of adding two
			1/2 tones together. This would result in a tetrachord that looks like:
			1/2 tone + 1/2 tone + 1 1/2 tones.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fifth case describes the a <span class="fst-italic">Tonic</span>
			(or Soft) Diatonic tetrachord. Technically, it doesn't involve a pycnum
			because the sum of the lower two intervals is 1 1/4 tones. And if a perfect
			Fourth is 2 1/2 tones, the highest interval would also be 1 1/4 tones.
			This particular scenario involves 1/2 tone + 3/4 tone + 1 1/4 tones.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sixth and last case describes a tetrachord with the largest
			possible combination of lower intervals: a diesis of 1/2 tone and a
			middle interval of 1 tone. This is the only shade that Aristoxenus
			describes in this 6-part process that has a high interval that is
			smaller than the sum of the two lower intervals.

		<p>
			Before wrapping up book 1, and getting into more details about the
			tetrachords at the beginning of book 2, we get another philosophical
			nugget that connects to Aristoxenus' focus on practice informed

			‚Äú...we must avoid the example set by the Haromnists in their

			dieses, that it can by no effort produce three dieses in
			succession.‚Äù (185)
		</h5>
		<p>
			Another aside is a snark from Aristoxenus to his predecessors. This
			quote suggests that the Haromnists (whoever they were), implied
			through their teachings that an octave could be divided into 28
			quarter tones. In theory, this is true because the octave is a
			series of 8 unique tones, 6 tones and 2 semi tones, which adds up to
			28 quarter tones. However, singing more than a tone (let alone an
			octave) in consecutive quarter tones isn't practical.

			"If ascending after two dieses, [the voice] can produce nothing less

			introduce any interval less than a tone.‚Äù" (185)
		</h5>
		<p>
			This quote goes into more detail about what Aristoxenus was setting
			up in the two previous quotes. He suggests that, when ascending, the
			voice naturally wants to complete the Fourth after a series of 2
			dieses. Conversely, when descending, the voice doesn't want to
			produce intervals any less than a tone. This is convenient because
			it aligns with cases of conjunct and disjunct scales that
			Aristoxenus goes into more detail about in book 2.

			This quote is talking about continuous double scales (and possibly
			multiple scales, as well). When producing continuous scales
			consisting of more than 1 tetrachord, each pitch in the lower
			tetrachord will form a perfect Fourth or perfect Fifth with a pitch
			higher in the scale. For example, if we look at the scale C > D > E
			> F > G > A > B > C, you can pick any of the first four notes, and
			it will form a perfect fifth with the note 5 notes above it.

			‚Äú...there are four intervals contained in the interval of the Fifth,
			two of which are usually equal, viz. those constituting the Pycnum,
			and two unequal--on the complement of the first concord, the other
			the excess of the interval of the Fifth over that of the Fourth, the
			unequal intervals which succeed the equal intervals do so in
			different order according as we ascend or descend the scale.‚Äù (186)

		<p>
			This quote is especially important because there's been so much
			emphasis on tetrachords here that the fifth has been largely
			neglected. That being said, Aristoxenus provides a brief and clear
			explanation (which is very rare in his writing üòÇ) for how Fifths
			arise in this tetrachordal system. Basically a Fifth contains all
			the same properties a tetrachord does, but with the addition of a
			tone at the top. The interval at the top of the Fifth will always be
			a tone in both conjunct and disjunct scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			A conjunct octave scale could look like this: C > D > E > F > G > A
			> Bb > C. The two tetrachords share F as a common tone, which makes
			it clear that they have identical intervallic structures. The Fifth
			is the result of adding the tone to the top of the higher
			tetrachord.
		</p>
		<p>
			A disjunct octave scale could look like this: C > D > E > F > G > A
			> B > C. The two tetrachords are separated by a tone in the middle,
			F > G. From this perspective we can see that the two halves of the
			octave are intervallically identical.
