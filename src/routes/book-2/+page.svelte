		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>
			There's part of me that feels that Book 2 would've been better off
			as Book 1, since there's a lot more foundational information here
			that clarifies the concepts of Book 1. However, Aristoxenus wrote so
			many books that it's hard to say whether or not someone reading this
			book would've already been familiar with the terms and concepts
			covered in Book 1. That being said, here are some of what I think
			are the most important takeaways from Book 2:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Sense perception is crucial to the study of music, and it's the
				main thing separating musicians from mathemeticians.
			</li>
			<li>
				The voice is the most important instrument for understanding the
				natural laws that inform Aristoxenus' theory of harmony.
			</li>
			<li>
				Just because there are exceptionally small intervals in some
				tetrachord genera, it doesn't mean that playing them
				consecutively and out of their scalar context produces a
				melodious result.
			</li>
			<li>
				Even though the genera have different shades, the ear can still
				distinguish what genera a tetrachord belongs to.
			</li>
			<li>
				Aristoxenus still has beef with his predecessors and their
				supposed stripping of music from their theories.
			</li>
			<li>
				The ditone is approximately a major Third, and can be derived by
				a series of perfect Fourths or Fifths.
			</li>
			<li>The Fifth is a Fourth with an added tone.</li>
		</ol>

			“The geometrician makes no use of his faculty of sense-perception.
			He does not in any degree train his sight to discriminate the
			straight line, the circle, or any other figure, such training
			belonging rather to the practice of the carpenter, the turner, or
			some other such handicraftsman. But for the student of musical
			science accuracy of sense-perception is a fundamental requirement.”
			(189)
		</h5>
		<p>
			I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the aesthetic of
			Aristoxenus' theory of harmony is our senses should guide our
			theories. Mathemeticians don't readily use their senses to dictate
			their theories, so why has theory up to this point been so number
			centric? Aristoxenus likens the musician to the artisan, which I
			think is an interesting comparison, since artisinal work is often
			associated with the average person, and education is often
			associated with the elite. There's almost a sense of trying to
			distribute music theory to the masses, which seems the most fair
			considering that music is generally beloved by everyone.
