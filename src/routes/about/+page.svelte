			A brief intro to Aristoxenus, and <span class="fst-italic"
				>Elementa Harmonica</span>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Aristoxenus of Tarentum was one of the foremost philosophers of his
			time. Although he authored upwards of 453 books during his lifetime
			covering topics beyond the realm of music, his treatise on harmony, <span
				class="fst-italic">Elementa Harmonica</span
			>, isn't only arguably his most important contribution to the music
			theory of his time, but it's also one of the most important insights
			we have to music from Greek antiquity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the span of the three books that make up the treatise, in
			comparison to Greek theorists that preceded him, Aristoxenus wrote
			about theory from a "practicality-first" perspective. By no means
			does he entirely do away with the mathematical principles that
			informed his practice; however, there seems to be a stronger
			emphasis on whether or not any theoretical pitch material is
			pragmatic to the practicing musician.

		<h3>My attempt to introduce Aristoxenus' theories</h3>
		<div id="excerpt">
			<p>
				Because this website is now dedicated to the entire treatise, I
				want to start off by saying that the original inspiration is a
				particular section from <span class="fst-italic"
					>Elementa Harmonica</span>
				where Aristoxenus describes the
				<a class="accent-text" href="{base}/differences-of-the-genera"
					>differences of the genera
				</a>. If you have no previous experience with Greek music theory
				(like me before reading 😔), you might find the treatise to be
				challenging to grasp because of the very stream of conscious
				driven style, as well as the core vocabulary that Aristoxenus
				assumes the reader knows. The rest of this article is going to
				attempt to explain some of what I think are the biggest
				takeaways from this section. But first, let's cover some key
				terms as they are referenced in and around the excerpt.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another important tidbit is that I'm using a particular
				translation of the treatise, <span class="fst-italic"
					>The Harmonics of Aristoxenus</span> authored by Henry S. Macran.
				I'll be including page numbers, which are specific to this book.
				It has detailed notation and a hefty notes section that explains
				a lot of what I'm going to attempt to explain here.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as the structure of the rest of the webpages devoted to
				each of the 3 books are concerned, I'm going to include quotes
				from the translation that I found particularly meaningful to
				Aristoxenus' overall message, as well as some of my own
				commentary. Instead of a table of contents, I'm using color
				coding and a legend to help you identify quotes related to
				themes from the summary.
